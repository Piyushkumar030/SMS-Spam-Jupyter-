# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is an **SMS Spam Classifier** using Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to detect whether an SMS message is spam or not based on a dataset of SMS messages. The project is built using **Python** and utilizes various ML models for classification.

## Introduction
The SMS Spam Classifier project uses **Machine Learning** algorithms and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The project processes and cleans the dataset, applies various ML models for training, and evaluates their performance to choose the best model for classification.

This project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, where the data processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation all take place interactively.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Programming Language
- **Jupyter Notebook** - For interactive coding and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning models
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **NLTK** - For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal
- **XGBoost** - For advanced boosting-based models
- **Seaborn** - For data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages that are labeled as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam). It can be found in the file `spam.csv`( taken from 'kaggle.com').

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **label**: Label indicating whether the message is spam or ham.
- **message**: The text of the SMS message.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Piyushkumar030/SMS-Spam-Jupyter-.git

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

cd SMS-Spam-Jupyter-
pip install -r requirements.txt



Step 3: Open the Jupyter Notebook
After installing the necessary dependencies, open the Jupyter notebook (SMS-Spam detection using ml(MAIN).ipynb) by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook SMS-Spam\ detection\ using\ ml\(MAIN\).ipynb
This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the code step-by-step.

Step 4: Run the Notebook
Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Vectorize the text data (using techniques like TF-IDF).
Train various machine learning models.
Evaluate the models and choose the best one.
Code Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

bash
Copy

â”œâ”€â”€ SMS-Spam detection using ml(MAIN).ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with the project code
â”œâ”€â”€ spam.csv                                   # SMS spam dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ model.pkl                                  # Saved model after training
â”œâ”€â”€ vectorizer.pkl                             # Saved vectorizer for feature extraction
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt                          # List of dependencies for the project
â””â”€â”€ README.md                                  # Project documentation (this file)
Usage
Once the Jupyter notebook is running, you will:

Preprocess the data: Clean the dataset by removing unwanted characters and stopwords.
Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training: Train multiple classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The model's performance can be seen in the results, and the final model will be saved in model.pkl for later use.

NLTK Datasets
To ensure that all required datasets for NLTK are downloaded, you will need to execute the following code in the notebook:

* python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
This will download the punkt tokenizer and stopwords datasets needed for text processing.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of Machine Learning and NLP to detect spam messages in SMS data. The notebook allows you to interactively explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train different models, and evaluate their performance. You can expand this project by experimenting with additional models, tuning hyperparameters, or adding more features.

## Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimize the models for better accuracy.
Deep Learning Models: Explore neural networks and other deep learning approaches for spam classification.
Real-time Detection: Implement the model for real-time SMS classification in a mobile app or web service.
